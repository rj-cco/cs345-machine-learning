# cs345-machine-learning

In this project, machine learning algorithms (linear vs logistic regression, and decision trees) were applied to the breast cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to evaluate any resulting differences in performance and draw conclusions based on these results. 

The project was done in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
